           <p>Since I didn't have a picture of me playing video games I just stole it off the internet but they are playing my favorite game on xbox FIFA which is pretty cool. after a long day of school coming to video games was a safehaven for me and helped me wind down. It truly was a one of a kind experience playing with my friends have 5th grade. Thank you XBOX, you made my childhood just a little bit better</p>
